This repository was created for studying.

It concerns the applications in C# I've developed.

The folder called "Compilers" is related to compiler development. There are two folders inside. In the first one you can find a finished **lexical and syntactic analyser**. In the second folder there is a **semantic analyser**.
Detailed information for the every analyser can be found inside the corresponding folder in Ukrainian.

The folder called "OOP_Design_Patterns" concerns Object-Oriented Programming subject. There are "Coursework" and "Labs" folders.
In the "Coursework" folder you can find a project, that implements the next design patterns: **Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Strategy, Template Method, State, Prototype**. It's a simulator, that allows you to organize different scenarios for each day in the children's camp.
In the "Labs" folder there are five laboratory works concerning design patterns development:
1. Implementation of structural design patterns: **Decorator** and **Bridge**.
2. Implementation of complex structural design patterns: **Adapter** and **Proxy**.
3. Implementation of creational design patterns: **Abstract Factory** and **Prototype**.
4. Implementation of behavioral design patterns: **State** and **Strategy**.
5. Implementation of complex behavioral design patterns: **Command** and **Chain of responsibility**.

The folder called "TPPS" relates to "Software systems design technologies" subject. There are three practices:
1. Description of the second practice can be found in the corresponding folder.
2. The third practice is a utility that allows you to calculate the number of lines of code, 
the number of blank lines, the number of physical and logical lines, the number of lines with comments and an estimate of the commenting level.
3. The fourth practice is a utility that calculates object-oriented metrics (DIT, NOC and MOOD metrics).
